<h3 style="font-family:courier;color:lightsteelblue">About Me</h3>
<p>My name is Janet Xing and I am 14 years old. During the 2020-2021 school year, I will be in 10th grade at Amador Valley High School. Some of my activites include dance, drawing and playing the violin. I have been dancing for 9 years and have won multiple awards. I have taken drawing classes since kindergarten. When I was younger, I played the piano. In middle school, I participated in ice skating. But here I am, in quarantine, making a web page for an AP computer science principles class.</p>

<h3 style="font-family:courier;color:lightsteelblue">Purpose</h3>
<p>This page was created for the purpose of informing teachers that I am capable of doing my work (even if it isn't that good). It might not be what you are looking for but at least I tried :). There were no specific instructions on how I should have made this webpage either so I tried to demonstrate my knowledge by using different fonts, colors, sizes, images, and a page separator.</p>
